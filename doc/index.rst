Welcome to modCnet's documentation!
==================================

ac4Cnet is a deep learning framework designed to harness the power of Oxford Nanopore direct RNA sequencing for precise identification of N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C) sites, a crucial aspect in RNA modification studies. By effectively distinguishing ac4C from unmodified cytidine and 5-methylcytosine (m5C), ac4Cnet enables accurate estimation of modification rates at each ac4C site. Through rigorous validation on independent in vitro datasets and a human cell line, ac4Cnet showcases its robustness, versatility, and immense potential in advancing the understanding and exploration of ac4C modifications in mRNA.

To use ac4Cnet, you can follow the instructions below:
